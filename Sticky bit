# 📌 Sticky Bit in Linux

## 📖 What is Sticky Bit?
- Sticky Bit is a **special permission** used **only on directories**.
- It prevents users from deleting or renaming **files owned by others** in a shared directory.
- Symbol in `ls -l`: `t` at the end of permissions.

Example:  
drwxrwxrwt 10 root root 4096 Aug 31 12:20 /tmp


👉 The `t` at the end means sticky bit is set.

---

## ⚡ Real-time Use
- Used in **shared directories** like `/tmp`.  
- Without sticky bit → any user could delete another user’s files.  
- With sticky bit → only **file owner or root** can delete/rename the file.

---

## 🔨 Practical Example

### Step 1: Create a shared directory
```bash
mkdir /tmp/shared_dir
chmod 777 /tmp/shared_dir

Step 2: Add sticky bit

chmod +t /tmp/shared_dir
ls -ld /tmp/shared_dir
# drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 4096 Aug 31 12:20 /tmp/shared_dir


Step 3: Test with two users

# Login as user1
su - user1
cd /tmp/shared_dir
touch file_user1.txt

# Login as user2
su - user2
cd /tmp/shared_dir
touch file_user2.txt

# user1 tries to delete user2’s file
rm file_user2.txt
# Permission denied ❌

# user1 can delete their own file
rm file_user1.txt   # ✅ works
